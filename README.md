# 100 days 100 Scripts

For a long time, I wanted to take up this challenge. But I was always procrastinating. Finally, I started this last week. 

The objective of the challenge is very simple. I will write 1 python script a day for 100 days. It doesn't matter it's small or big, doesn't matter it's deep learning or executing the shell command, I just gotta write the code daily. 

## Day 1:  generate_chrome_icon

- This script will generate different resoltion icons for chrome extensions when you give a png or JPG as input.

## Day 2: generate_two_display_wallpaper
- This script will merge two wallpaper horizontally and generates two monitor wallpaper.

## Day 3: download_all_images

- When a static link is given it will scrap the page and download all the images in the page.

## Day 4: zip_react_projects

- It removed the node_modules and create a zip of the react project. Will be helpful to zip and mail it to someone. 

## Day 5: append_read_me.py
- This script will read the last updated python file in the folder and automatically append it into the read.me with the day number


## Day 6: convert_pdf_to_csv.py
- This scripts helps you to convert the given PDF into CSV file and stores it in local


## Day 7: push_todays_script.py
- This script will automatically track the updated files and commit those files and push them to the git.

## Day 8: update_gnome_wallpaper.py
- This script will randomly select an image file from a folder of files and update the wallpaper in ubuntu

## Day 9: check_site_live.py
- This script checks if a site is active or not in the given intervals. if it's down it sends a notification.

## Day 10: dev_to_post_generate.py
- This script uses a template and generates my 100 days python scripts posts for dev.to by checking the last updated file in Readme. This is helpful for me to quickly update dev.to post without manually copy pasting things again and again
